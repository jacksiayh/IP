Cubix is a website catered to those who enjoy Rubik's cubes and is a platform for like-minded cubing enthusiasts to communicate and form social connections. Through our website, these passionate cube solvers can find new ways and algorithms to solve their Rubiks cubes and make this craft even more interesting. Furthermore, our website presents itself with a diversity of Rubiks cubes that appeal to cubing enthusiasts.
 
## Design Process
We made this website in mind with a younger target audience, being kids, teenagers and young adults who are more energetic and passionate about solving various different types of Rubik's cubes.
The background of the website features the different types of colours on the Rubik's cube to give the users a familiar touch and enjoyable experience to the website.
The bold colours help users to read text more easily and scroll through the website without a strain on their eyes.

As a customer, I want to access the website easily so that I can explore the different functions with ease.
As a customer, I want to view the Rubik's cubes on the website fast so that i can decide whether to buy the products.
As a customer, I want to enter the Rubik's cube minigame, so taht I can challenge myself and improve my cube solving abilities.

## Testing
1. Login page
    1. Go to Login page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid username and verify that a relevant error message appears.
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

2. Check Out page
    1. Go to Check out page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email format and verify that a relevant error message appears.
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Different browsers and screen sizes for our project:
It has been made to fit the size of any various sizes of screen width and height. For example, the navbar becomes a hamburger bar once the width of the page becomes a certain value. This hamburger menu then opens up to show where the navbar has gone to. The containers in products and solutions page will also fit to the mobile view by becoming a single column of containers instead of its normal 3x2 pattern. 

<!--In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.-->

Some bugs or problems:
Sometimes the iFrame for the 3x3 Lego Rubik's cube does not appear when you press it and let it get transported to the shopping cart page.
The remove item button sometimes disappears in the shopping cart page too.
There are some unknown errors in the Rubik's cube minigame Rubik's cube that just can't seem to be fixed, however it does not affect the code at all.

<!--You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.-->
